 * Follower Control by Tyruswoo
 * ===========================================================================
 * Tyruswoo's Follower Control plugin allows greater control of party
 * follower movement.  It allows using these commands on any follower:
 *    - Set Move Route
 *    - Show Balloon Icon
 *    - Show Animation
 *    - Transfer Player
 * Now you can easily make cool cutscenes involving the party's followers
 * and leader!
 * ===========================================================================
 * Plugin commands in brief:
 *    Follower 0          // Target the leader (for Set Move Route of player).
 *    Follower 1          // Target follower 1 (for Set Move Route of player).
 *    Follower 2          // Etc.  Works for up to 50 followers.
 *    Follower StopChase  // Followers stop chasing the leader.
 *    Follower Chase      // Followers chase the leader again.
 *    Follower <Name>     // Target follower associated with actor named <Name>.
 *    Follower Variable <varId> //Target follower based on value of a variable.
 *    Follower Actor <actorId>  //Target follower associated with actor <actorId>
 *
 * For best results, use the above Plugin Commands in combination with the
 * Set Move Route command.  Make cool cutscenes!  :)
 * ===========================================================================
 * Example of how to use this plugin:
 *
 * Here is an example of using the Plugin Commands,
 * combined with the Set Move Route command.
 * Use the following commands within an event:
 *
 * Plugin Command: Follower StopChase  // * This changes follower behavior.
 *                                     //   They no longer follow the leader.
 * Plugin Command: Follower 1      // * This makes the Set Move Route command
 *                                 //   target Follower 1 instead of the leader.
 * (Now Set Move Route of player.) // * Instead of the party leader, follower 1
 *                                 //   will move independently.
 * Plugin Command: Follower 0      // * This resets how Set Move Route works.
 *                                 //   Now it will target the leader again.
 * (Now Set Move Route of player.) // * The party leader will move, but the
 *                                 //   followers will not chase the leader,
 *                                 //   since we used "Follower StopChase".
 * Plugin Command: Follower Chase  // * Resets follower behavior, so they
 *                                 //   chase the leader again.
 * Plugin Command: Follower Chase current //
 * ===========================================================================
 * Details of Plugin Commands to target a follower instead of the leader
 * for Set Move Route, Show Balloon Icon, Show Animation, or Transfer Player
 * commands.
 *
 * Example:
 *      Follower 1
 * The plugin command "Follower 1" will make all future Set Move Route commands
 * affect the first follower, i.e. the character following the party leader.
 * This effect will continue until resetting by using the following
 * plugin command:
 *      Follower 0
 * The plugin command "Follower 0" causes default behavior of all Move Route
 * event commands affecting the party leader.
 *
 * Important: Make sure you use plugin command "Follower 0" to reset, so
 * that future Set Move Route commands will affect the party leader!
 *
 * Number Codes:
 *
 * 0 = Leader
 * 1 = First Follower
 * 2 = Second Follower
 * 3 = Third Follower
 * 4 = Fourth Follower
 * 5 = Fifth Follower
 * And so on for up to 50 followers.
 *
 * If the selected follower is not present (i.e. the party is too small, and
 * that follower spot is not filled), then commands sent to that follower number
 * will have no effect.
 *
 * Notes on Transfer Player:
 * - No matter the follower/leader targeted, using a Transfer Player to go to
 *   a new map will always rejoin the party, making the followers chase the
 *   leader again, and setting the leader as the target (same as using
 *   Plugin Command "Follower 0").
 * - If transferring to the current map, then the targeted follower determines
 *   the effect of Transfer Player:
 *      > If the leader is targeted (Follower 0), then we check whether
 *        followers are chasing.
 *           >> If they are chasing, then we perform a Transfer Player type
 *              function, bringing the party together and performing the
 *              chosen fade.
 *           >> If the followers are not chasing, then the leader is
 *              teleported without affecting the followers' positions.
 *      > If a follower is targeted, then the follower is teleported
 *        without affecting the other followers' or leader's position.
 *
 * Tip:  If you want to transfer the followers and leader all independently
 *       during a cutscene, then be sure to use Plugin Command "Follower
 *       StopChase".  That way, transfers of the leader within the same map
 *       will no longer affect the followers, allowing for better cutscenes.
 *       (Note that this also works with TYR_CameraControl, allowing for
 *       the camera to stay focused on the correct camera target.)
 * ===========================================================================
 * Details of Plugin Commands to make followers stop and start following:
 *
 * Follower Chase
 *      Makes all followers chase the leader and each other.
 *      This is the default behavior of followers.
 * 
 * Follower StopChase
 *      Makes all followers stop chasing the leader and each other.
 *      This is useful for cutscenes in which the party leader moves around
 *      alone, allowing followers and leader to all move independently.
 * 
 * Follower StopChase Selected
 *      Makes the currently selected follower stop chasing the leader.
 *      If other followers are chasing, they will continue chase and close
 *      the gap in the line, if any.
 * 
 * Follower StopChase 1
 *      Makes the first follower (i.e. the one directly after the leader)
 *      stop chasing. If other followers are chasing, they will continue
 *      chase, close the gap, etc.
 *
 * Follower StopChase 2
 *      Makes the second follower (i.e. the third party member) stop chasing.
 *      Other followers, if chasing, will continue chase.
 * 
 * Follower StopChase Charlie
 *      The actor named Charlie will stop chasing. Other followers are not
 *      affected.
 * 
 * Follower Chase Selected
 *      Makes the currently selected follower chase the leader. 
 *      The other followers' Chase / StopChase behavior will not change.
 *      Follower Chase has all the same individual syntax options that are
 *      available to Follower StopChase.
 *
 * More notes about individual StopChase and Chase:
 * * Transferring to a different area, or calling StopChase or Chase on the
 *   whole party, will cancel all individual StopChase and Chase instructions.
 * * If a Chase or StopChase action is called on the party leader,
 *   then it will apply to the entire party.
 * 
 * ===========================================================================
 * Details of alternative ways to select a follower:
 *
 * Follower Variable variableID
 *      Where variableId is the ID number of the desired variable.
 *      This will use Variable variableId to determine which follower to
 *      select. If Variable variableId has not been set, then it will be 0,
 *      which will select the leader. If Variable variableId has been set to 3,
 *      then follower 3 will be selected. Etc. In this way, the Control Variables
 *      event command can be used to set a variable Id, which in turn selects
 *      a follower.
 *      Examples:
 *           Follower Variable 3
 *                This uses variable 3 to determine the follower. Set variable 3
 *                to the desired follower, then use this command to set the
 *                selected follower to the value of Variable 3.
 *           Follower Variable 27
 *                Same as above, but variable 27 is used. If variable 27 has
 *                not been set, it will be 0, and the leader will be selected.
 *                If variable 27 has been set to 1, then the first follower
 *                will be selected. Etc.
 *      This can also be used in combination with event Loops to cycle through
 *      all followers in turn.
 *
 * Follower Name
 *     where Name is the name of the follower's associated actor.
 *     Examples:
 *          Follower Harold
 *                This will select whichever follower is associated with
 *                the actor named Harold.
 *          Follower Marsha
 *                This will select whichever follower is associated with
 *                the actor named Marsha.
 *     This can be useful for certain cutscenes. For example, if you want a
 *     certain follower to have a question mark bubble, or to do a jump
 *     before speaking, etc, you can select that follower even if you do not
 *     know their position in the group. This can be helpful if you allow
 *     the player to alter the marching order of their characters' party.
 *
 * Follower Actor ID
 *     where ID is the ID number of the follower's associated actor.
 *     Examples:
 *          Follower Actor 2
 *                This will select whichever follower is associated with
 *                the actor of actorID number 2.
 *          Follower Actor 39
 *                This will select whichever follower is associated with
 *                the actor of actorID number 39.
 *     This can be useful just like selecting a follower by name, as described
 *     above. However, by using an actor ID, we can select the desired actor,
 *     even if the name of the actor has been modified. This is useful for
 *     games that allow the player to change the names of all their actors.
 * ===========================================================================
 * Synonyms:  Here are a few alternate ways to write the same plugin command:
 *
 * For the term "Follower", you may type any of these:
 *      Follower       follower       FOLLOWER
 *      Follow         follow         FOLLOW
 *
 * For the term "Chase", you may type any of these:
 *      Chase          chase          CHASE
 *      Chase True     chase true     CHASE TRUE
 *      Chase Start    chase start    CHASE START
 *
 * For the term "StopChase", you may type any of these:
 *      StopChase      stopchase      STOPCHASE
 *      stopChase      Stopchase
 *      Chase False    chase false    CHASE FALSE
 *      Chase Stop     chase stop     CHASE STOP
 * ===========================================================================
 * v1.00  January 17, 2016:
 *        Created the plugin and added the following features:
 *        - Plugin command "Follower" to select followers.
 *        - Set Move Route effect on followers.
 *        - Plugin commands "StopChase" and "Chase" to control followers
 *          chasing the leader.
 *
 * v1.01  January 19, 2016:
 *        Added the following features:
 *        - Show Balloon Icon for followers.
 *        - Show Animation for followers.
 *        - Transfer Player for followers.
 *
 * v1.02  January 19, 2016:
 *        Worked on fixing a bug.  However, errors still occured.  See below.
 *
 * v1.03  January 20, 2016:
 *        Fixed the bug found on January 19th.
 *        - Previously, the "Follower" plugin command had to be used prior to
 *          ever using Set Move Route or other featured commands in your game;
 *          If the "Follower" plugin command was not used first, the game would
 *          freeze.  Now, the plugin no longer requires this!  If you never
 *          use a "Follower" plugin command, your game will function as it
 *          would by default, without errors.
 *
 * v1.04  January 20, 2016:
 *        Added feature:
 *        - If a follower is on the same tile as the leader, and then
 *          Set Move Route is used to "Turn toward Player", then the
 *          follower will now turn to face the same direction as the leader!
 *          So, by using the Gather Followers event command, then using
 *          Set Move Route "Turn toward Player", it is possible to make
 *          followers be in a predictable position (right where the leader is),
 *          from whence the followers can then be sent out in a pre-prepared
 *          formation.  This allows for ease of creating Common Events for
 *          for your various formations of follower movement!
 *
 * v1.05  Sept. 4, 2018:
 *        Added feature:
 *        - Now, when StopChase is on, and the leader's MoveRoute is
 *          caused to jump, the followers will not jump.
 *
 * v1.06  Dec. 22, 2018:
 *        Added features:
 *        - Now can select follower based on a variable's value, using
 *          the Follower Variable <VariableId> plugin command.
 *        - Now can select follower based on their actor's name, using
 *          the Follower <Name> plugin command.
 *
 * v1.07  Dec. 31, 2018:
 *        Added feature:
 *        - Now can select follower based on an actor's ID, using
 *          the Follower Actor <actorId> plugin command.
 *
 * v1.08  Feb. 27, 2019:
 *        Added feature/fixed bug:
 *        - Followers can be set to have unique qualities of the following,
 *          using Set Move Route:
 *            - Opacity
 *            - Blend Mode
 *            - Walk Animation On/Off
 *            - Step Animation On/Off
 *            - Direction Fix On/Off
 *            - Transparency On/Off
 *          For these qualities, followers will retain their individual
 *          qualities. However, if StopChase is Off, and one of these
 *          qualities is applied to the player, then the same quality
 *          will be applied to all followers, as well. Therefore, if you
 *          want to apply any of the above qualities to only the leader,
 *          StopChase must be On.
 *        - Also, followers will now retain their own Move Speed as long as
 *          StopChase is On, even if the followers are moving and the player
 *          is moving at the same time. (However, unlike the above qualities,
 *          if StopChase is turned back Off, followers will immediately
 *          be reset to the player's Move Speed.)
 *
 * v1.09  March 8, 2019:
 *        Added feature:
 *        - A new script call was added, which can be used within the
 *          Set Move Route command to make any follower pathfind to any
 *          coordinates on the map, to any of the current map's events,
 *          or to any follower. 
 *        - First, select the desired Follower. Then, within the
 *          Set Move Route command, use one of these scripts:
 *
 *            this.path(17, 5)
 *              This finds the path to x coordinate 17, y coordinate 5.
 *
 *            this.path("event", 3)
 *              This finds the path to Event 3 on the current map.
 *
 *            this.path("follower", 2)
 *              This finds the path to Follower 2.
 *
 *          For whichever of the above pathing arguments you use,
 *          the player or follower will only move one step each time
 *          you call the script. You can use the script as many times
 *          as you need, in order to make the player or follower step
 *          toward the target for that many steps.
 *        - Note: This script call also works for events. Just use the script
 *          call within Set Move Route.
 *        - Note: This script call has no variability, so it always
 *          finds the straightest path, and will always yield the same result
 *          every time. (This is different from the "Approach" movement type,
 *          which has randomness, producing variability.)
 *
 * v1.10  June 23, 2019:
 *        Added feature:
 *        - A new plugin command was added, which allows switching the
 *          image of the currently selected follower, based on the currently
 *          selected follower's default image.
 *        - To use poses, you first need to create the appropriately named
 *          pose image files. Then, you can call those files for your
 *          follower at any time. The follower's default image will be used
 *          to determine what their poses can be.
 *        - You can create an infinite number of your own poses! To create a
 *          pose, you need to have the default image file for the character,
 *          and then create another image file with an underscore added at
 *          the end, followed by the name of the pose (in lowercase letters).
 *          For example, if our character's default image is:
 *
 *                $McKathlinIsAwesome.png
 *
 *          Then our pose image for a wink should be named:
 *
 *                $McKathlinIsAwesome_wink.png
 *
 *          Or, our pose image for that character's wounded image should be:
 *
 *                $McKathlinIsAwesome_wounded.png
 *
 *          And likewise for any other pose images for that character. You can
 *          have as many poses as you want! There is no maximum.
 *
 *          Important Note: The poses must all have the same index value as the
 *          default pose. In other words, the pose images must be the same size
 *          as the default image, with the pose at the same position within the
 *          image file.
 *        - For example, if we want to make a certain follower wink, we first
 *          select the follower. Then, make that follower change to a wink
 *          pose:
 *
 *                Follower Pose wink
 *
 *          Have the follower hold the pose for a moment or say something, etc,
 *          then return the follower to a default pose. There are several ways
 *          to do this, and all are equivalent:
 *
 *                Follower Pose default
 *                Follower Pose normal
 *                Follower Pose none
 *                Follower Pose stand
 *                Follower Pose standing
 *                
 *          All of the above plugin commands do the same thing of returning
 *          the follower to their default pose.
 *
 * v1.11  August 2, 2019:
 *        Modified feature: There are now two ways to select a follower by
 *        their name. You can select a follower by their actor's name, as
 *        listed in the database.
 *        - By default, followers will be selected based on their actor's
 *          name in the database. For example:
 *
 *                Follower Shompta
 *
 *          The above searches the followers, and if a follower's actor has
 *          the name "Shompta" in the database, then that follower is selected.
 *        - You can, if so desired, still search for an actor based on their
 *          current name. The only reason to use this method is if
 *          you want special things to occur only when an actor has a special
 *          name that the player has entered in. For example, either of the
 *          following will select a follower who is currently named
 *          "SecretCode".
 *
 *                Follower CurrentName SecretCode
 *                Follower Current_Name SecretCode
 *
 *          If a player has indeed renamed an actor to be named "SecretCode",
 *          then the follower associated with that actor will be selected.
 *
 *
 * v2.00  January 24, 2020:
 *        This update greatly improves the pathfinding. As previously, you can
 *        use this.path() to make a follower move to specific coordinates,
 *        to a specific event, or to a specific follower. However, now the
 *        pathfinding allows avoiding obstacles. Note that in order for
 *        the follower to recgonize obstacles, you must also use the Set Move
 *        Route command to set Through Off prior to the movement. Then, use the
 *        Set Move Route command to run a Script of the this.path function.
 *       
 *        Examples of smart pathfinding that avoids obstacles:
 *
 *            this.path(17, 5)
 *              This finds the smart path to x coordinate 17, y coordinate 5.
 *
 *            this.path("event", 3)
 *              This finds the smart path to Event 3 on the current map.
 *
 *            this.path("follower", 2)
 *              This finds the smart path to Follower 2.
 *
 *        As previously, note that the follower will only move one step each
 *        time the script runs.
 *
 *        An excellent feature is that you can use this.path() not just on
 *        Set Move Route of followers, but also on the leader of the player's
 *        group, or even on any event's Set Move Route command!
 *
 *        Also importantly, if you use this in any cutscenes, the pathfinding
 *        calculation will remain the same, as long as the obstacles are in
 *        the same places!
 *
 *        You also have control over the pathfinding distance! By default,
 *        RPG Maker MV allows pathfinding of up to 12 tiles, and this is what
 *        is used to pathfind when the player uses the mouse or touchscreen to
 *        move. But, with Follower Control, you can now change the pathfinding
 *        distance for any follower, including the leader of the group, so
 *        you can allow the player to pathfind even farther if you want!
 *        You can also use this to modify how smart enemies are at pathfinding!
 *        Use this script inside a Set Move Route command:
 *
 *            this.pathMax(value)
 *
 *        Where value is how many tiles/steps you want the character to be able
 *        to pathfind around obstacles. For example:
 *
 *            this.pathMax(30)
 *
 *        The above allows pathfinding around obstacles, even if it requires
 *        looking 30 tiles around to find the best path.
 *
 *        If you want to use the previous pathfinding, which did not take
 *        obstacles into account, you can use scripts such as the following:
 *
 *        Examples of basic pathfinding that does not avoid obstacles:
 *
 *            this.moveToward(17, 5)
 *              This finds the basic path to x coordinate 17, y coordinate 5.
 *
 *            this.moveToward("event", 3)
 *              This finds the basic path to Event 3 on the current map.
 *
 *            this.moveToward("follower", 2)
 *              This finds the basic path to Follower 2.
 *
 *        Remember that each script call moves the character only one tile,
 *        i.e. only one step.
 *
 *
 * v2.1   April 19, 2020:
 *        Added a plugin parameter to control the Max Party Members. This
 *        allows you to have more than the default of 4 party members shown in
 *        the party while the player traverses the map.
 *
 * v2.2   Sept. 18, 2020:
 *        Fixed a bug in which it was possible to select a absent follower if
 *        the current $gameParty.battleMembers.length was less than
 *        $gameParty.maxBattleMembers. For example, if the Max Party Members
 *        is 4, and the current party size is 2, it was possible to select
 *        followers 2 and 3, even though they do not exist. This was not
 *        usually noticeable, because such followers are invisible. However,
 *        using Show Balloon Icon or Show Animation could cause balloons or
 *        animations to appear at the location of an absent follower.
 * 
 * v3.0   August 24, 2021:
 *        Fixed a bug that was causing crashes on save/load in some games.
 *        Ensured that move routes given to nonexistent followers are ignored.
 * 
 * v3.0.1  September 7, 2023:
 *         This plugin is now free and open source under the MIT license.
 * 
 * v3.1.0  January 18, 2024:
 *         The Chase and StopChase plugin commands can now target individual
 *         followers.
 * 
 * v3.1.1  In Development
 *         Fixed bug where Gather Followers command made the game get stuck
 *         if any followers weren't chasing. Now Gather Followers automatically
 *         makes all party members chase.
